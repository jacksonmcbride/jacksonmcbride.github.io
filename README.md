# My Personal Site
I thought that it would be cool to make a personal site that looked like the Windows 95 theme. Luckily for me, user [h01000110](https://github.com/h01000110) already made a jekyll theme for this. If you like the way I styled my site, check out tge full theme: [Windows 95](https://h01000110.github.io/20170917/windows-95)

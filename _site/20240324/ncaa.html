        		<h1 id="ncaa-fencing-a-weekend-recap">NCAA Fencing: A Weekend Recap</h1>
<p>This weekend was an intense mix of competition and camaraderie as I represented Columbia University at the NCAA Men’s Fencing Saber Individual, landing a 12th place finish, securing All-American status, and leading our team to a solid 3rd place. Achieving this with 11 competitors, against teams with 12, was a notable highlight.</p>

<h2 id="ups-and-downs">Ups and Downs</h2>
<p>Fencing is full of surprises, and this weekend was no exception. My performance had its moments, with unexpected losses to lower-ranking opponents and some satisfying wins against top fencers. It’s a reminder of how unpredictable and challenging this sport can be.</p>

<h2 id="travel-companions">Travel Companions</h2>
<p>A unique aspect of the event was traveling with fencers from Harvard and Yale. The pod consisted of Matt Linsky, Jordan Silversweig, Kevin Sohn, and myself. This was an especially nice group of guys because Matt, Jordan, and I all practice at the same club in New York sometimes.</p>

<h2 id="team-dynamics">Team Dynamics</h2>
<p>The weekend wasn’t just about fencing. It offered a chance to connect with teammates on a deeper level, sharing experiences and getting to know each other better outside the usual training sessions. I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with friends from my team as well as catch up with some friends at other schools.</p>

<p>A fun part of the weekend was the exchange of funny posters between the men’s and women’s teams. This gesture, which is a team tradition added a light-hearted element to the competition, showcasing our team spirit and creativity. It was fun to both create posters for my teammates as well as to see what they created for me. One of my teammates made a pun with my last name, joking that I am “married to the game</p>

# Mimi: The Personal Chatbot Project
My girlfriend LOVES cats. Seriously, 

## Project Overview

**Objective**: To replicate the experience of interacting with Mimi, my girlfriend's cat, through an AI-powered chatbot. 

**Inspiration**: My girlfriend was having a rough day, and said that she missed her cat

**Technologies Used**: A web app deployed using streamlit, written in pyhton 

## Features

- **Personalized Interactions**: Tailored to mimic Mimi's unique personality traits and preferences.
- **Customized Questioning**: Designed to ask specific questions related to your girlfriend's life, incorporating unique insights only Mimi would possess.
- **Exclusive Insights**: Provides exclusive facts and information about Mimi, fostering a deeper connection.
- **Authentic Engagement**: Facilitates meaningful conversations through personalized interactions and tailored responses.

## Technical Stack

- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for its advanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling Mimi to understand and generate conversation.
- **Web Development Frameworks**: I am still learning how to do web apps, so I just used streamlit to deploy this, lol

Privacy and Personalization

Since some content in the chatbot is personalized for my girlfriend and her cat, I'm unable to share the actual chatbot. However, you can find a brief demo below to see how it works and the types of responses it provides.

## Overview of the Fencing Dataset

The **USA Fencing Team Archives Dataset** brings together a comprehensive historical record of U.S. fencers and their national rankings dating back to 2010. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaxofgreee/usa-fencing-team-archives/data), where it provides valuable insights into the sport's evolving rankings over more than a decade. This dataset is unique not only in its scope but also in its precision—capturing the exact rankings as they were updated over time, offering a historical trajectory for each fencer in the dataset.

## What Makes This Dataset Unique

Unlike typical rankings data, this dataset is meticulously **comprehensive in time**. Each entry reflects the exact ranking of each fencer whenever USA Fencing updated its points. This time-based accuracy means users can analyze ranking fluctuations, compare fencers' progress, and understand trends across weapon categories, gender, and age groups over the years.

## How the Dataset Was Compiled

Creating this dataset required a series of scripts to automate and compile data across various rankings and time periods:

1. **Data Collection Script**: The dataset began with a script to retrieve all available ranking files from USA Fencing’s website. Each time USA Fencing released an update, this script would download the latest rankings.

2. **Data Parsing**: After collection, another script parsed the raw text files to identify each fencer's details, including **region**, **club**, **weapon**, **age group**, and **gender**.

3. **JSON Conversion**: Finally, I converted the parsed data into JSON files, organizing the data by weapon, gender, and age group. Each JSON file contains a list of fencers, and within each fencer’s data, there’s a **dictionary of dates and rankings**. This structure allows for easy access to the exact ranking of each fencer over time, enabling granular analysis.

## Dataset Features

Each entry in the dataset includes:

- **Fencer Details**: Name, club affiliation, region, and category (e.g., weapon, gender, age group).
- **Time-based Rankings**: A dictionary containing **dates** and **rankings** for each fencer, tracking their progression over time. 

This structure makes it possible to conduct a variety of analyses, from tracking individual fencers' progress over time to examining broader trends within different fencing categories.

## Potential Applications

The dataset can be used for a range of analytical purposes, including:

- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze how rankings change over time, providing insights into consistency, improvement, or declines.
- **Club and Regional Strength Analysis**: By aggregating ranking data by club or region, users can assess the strength and development of specific fencing communities.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Given the time-based nature of the data, it’s possible to apply predictive modeling techniques to forecast future rankings.

This project showcases my technical skills in **data scraping**, **data parsing**, and **structured data organization** for longitudinal sports analysis.

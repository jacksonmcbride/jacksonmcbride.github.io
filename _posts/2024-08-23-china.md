Over the past two weeks, I have enjoyed the amazing opporetunity to go to China, Hong Kong, and Macau. It has been an amazing experience, as I got to enjoy a new part of the world, while making friends and doing the sport I love.

    <h2>Hong Kong</h2>
    <p>We kicked off our trip with a few extra days in Hong Kong, an addition that wasn’t originally part of our itinerary. However, my teammates suggested that, since we were already heading to Macau, we should take the opportunity to explore Hong Kong. I'm really glad we made this detour. During our time in Hong Kong, we got to experience the vibrant city, its beautiful beaches, and some fantastic shopping. I owe a huge thanks to Tim Lim and Ethan Leung, who were not only great teammates but also amazing guides and friends. They took us to the best local food spots and shopping areas, ensuring that our time in Hong Kong was as smooth and enjoyable as possible.</p>

## Macau
The first event of our trip was the 2024 International Collegiate Fencing Invitational Tournament, hosted by Macau University of Science and Technology. The event spanned two days, with the first day dedicated to an individual competition, where I secured third place. The second day featured a team event, where we were randomly assigned to different teams. My performance on the first day wasn’t my best, which wasn’t entirely surprising since I hadn’t been practicing much over the summer. I ended up losing to Neil Lilov after missing around eight parries and ripostes—definitely something to focus on when I return to my regular training routine. The second day was much more relaxed; no team was particularly focused on winning, and everyone was fencing with weapons they don’t usually compete with, making it a fun and light-hearted day. Given that, I’m not too bothered that our team finished last.

Beyond fencing, we had the chance to explore Macau, which was a unique experience made even better by the company of other American college students. The university organized a city tour, allowing us to dive into Macau’s rich culture and history. And once again, Tim Lim and Ethan Leung returned to show us around, enhancing our experience even further. I must also express my gratitude to the volunteers, especially Yvonne, who was Columbia’s designated volunteer. From the moment we arrived in Macau, she ensured everything was perfectly organized and that we had everything we needed for a great stay. She even spent time with us when she could, and her presence was truly delightful. On our last night in Macau, we decided to return to Hong Kong, where Tim and Ethan once again guided us around, and even Yvonne joined. It was an incredible experience from start to finish.

## Beijing/Tsinghua
The final leg of my trip took me to Tsinghua University in Beijing for fencing, and all I can say is WOW! I was genuinely blown away. The first thing that struck me was how incredibly clean and modern Beijing is—something I didn't expect, especially given the stories my parents told me about the city in the 90s. Tsinghua University may have been my favorite part of the entire trip. The fencing facilities there were more impressive than any I’ve seen in the U.S., with everything newly built just last year. The modern design included excellent lighting, numerous strips, lifting areas, and even plants that added a nice touch. The students at Tsinghua were equally remarkable. Kira and Yinfeng were incredibly helpful throughout our time there, showing us around and making sure we had everything we needed.

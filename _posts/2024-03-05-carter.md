# Carter: The Texting Emulator
My brother, Carter, is a NOTORIOUSLY BAD texter. No matter how important the matter, he will respond in 2-3 business weeks (if you are lucky). As you could imagine, this becomes very frustrating for me and my family. Therefore I decided to take matters into my own hands. Using OpenAI's Assistant framework, I designed a chatbot version of my brother, so I could talk to him, even when he doesnt want to talk to me. Using a combination of probabilistic response generation, and some creative prompt engineering, I was able to get this chatbot to simulate the hair-pulling experience of texting my brother. While I would love to host this publicly, OpenAI's services are not free, and college is not cheap. If you are interested, I can send you the url, but to be honest, it may be a waste of time trying to have a detailed conversation with (AI) Carter.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: To replicate the experience of interacting with Carter through an AI-powered chatbot. 

**Inspiration**: After making a chatbot for my girlfriend, I thought it would be fun to make one for my parents as well. 

**Technologies Used**: A web app deployed using streamlit, written in Python.

## Features

- **Personalized Interactions**: Tailored to mimic Carter's unique personality traits and preferences.
- **Customized Questioning**: Designed to ask specific questions related to our shared experiences, incorporating inside jokes and memories only Carter and I would understand.
- **Exclusive Insights**: Provides exclusive facts and information about Carter, fostering a deeper connection.
- **Authentic Engagement**: Facilitates meaningful conversations through personalized interactions and tailored responses.

## Technical Stack

- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for its advanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling Carter to understand and generate conversation.
- **Web Development Frameworks**: I really don't know much about web app deployment (learning though), so I chose to deploy using streamlit.

Privacy and Personalization

Since some content in the chatbot is personalized for my brother and me, I'm unable to share the actual chatbot. However, you can find a brief demo below to see how it works and the types of responses it provides.

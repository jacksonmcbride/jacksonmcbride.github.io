# Carter: The Texting Emulator
This project is all about emulating the texting style of my brother, Carter, in a comedic manner. Designed to mirror his texting habits, it injects humor into our conversations. After creating a similar chatbot for my girlfriend, I thought it would be entertaining to extend the concept to my family by creating one for my parents to text my brother. Both my parents found it amusing, and Carter himself approved of the idea. However, he did point out that the chatbot's responses are not extreme enough, as it makes it seem like he texts more frequently than he does in reality.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: To replicate the experience of interacting with Carter through an AI-powered chatbot. 

**Inspiration**: After making a chatbot for my girlfriend, I thought it would be fun to make one for my parents as well. 

**Technologies Used**: A web app deployed using streamlit, written in Python.

## Features

- **Personalized Interactions**: Tailored to mimic Carter's unique personality traits and preferences.
- **Customized Questioning**: Designed to ask specific questions related to our shared experiences, incorporating inside jokes and memories only Carter and I would understand.
- **Exclusive Insights**: Provides exclusive facts and information about Carter, fostering a deeper connection.
- **Authentic Engagement**: Facilitates meaningful conversations through personalized interactions and tailored responses.

## Technical Stack

- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for its advanced natural language processing capabilities, enabling Carter to understand and generate conversation.
- **Web Development Frameworks**: I really don't know much about web app deployment (learning though), so I chose to deploy using streamlit.

Privacy and Personalization

Since some content in the chatbot is personalized for my brother and me, I'm unable to share the actual chatbot. However, you can find a brief demo below to see how it works and the types of responses it provides.

As a junior at Columbia University, I proudly serve as the captain of our esteemed fencing team. My decision to join Columbia was deeply influenced by its rich legacy in fencing, renowned as a dynasty program in the sport. To put this into perspective, Columbia boasts more NCAA titles in fencing than Alabama does in football.

## Achievements
During my time here, our team has clinched two Ivy League championships, a testament to our collective dedication and skill. Under my leadership, the men's saber squad has experienced unprecedented success, with only four losses since I assumed the role of captain. This remarkable performance stands as the best record of any squad within the past three years, showcasing our relentless pursuit of excellence and unwavering determination on the fencing strip.

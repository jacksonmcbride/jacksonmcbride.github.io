## My Path So Far
 I'm in my third year at Columbia University, majoring in data science and economics. This choice stems from an interest in understanding other disciplines through the use of cool statistics and computation. Fencing is another significant part of my life here. As the team captain, I've learned more about leadership and resilience than I ever expected. Our team winning the Ivy League championships twice has been a highlight, it is my family of teammates which keeps me going.

## Interests and Hobbies
 My academic pursuits aside, I'm drawn to machine learning for its potential to solve specific, real-world problems. I also spend time reading about pharmacology, psychology, and history, not really for any practical reason other than I find them to be fascinating. Maybe one day I will get a PhD in one of these fields. While I hope to make a meaningful impact on the world someday, I'm still exploring what that might look like. In the meantime, I enjoy snowboarding for its rush and freedom, and I dabble in creating digital content, which allows me to express myself and connect with others in creative ways.
